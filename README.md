# twitter-bot-for-fun

This is a bot that replies to people that say certain words, specified in the query. In this case, it's set to an @.

It was made in NodeJS with Twit API


CONSIDERATIONS

Given that this bot works with queries, I do NOT recommend using it for replying. It's better to use it for retweeting/liking, since theres a bug where the bot replies the ammounts of queries if too many people tag it at the same time.
